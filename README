=======================================================================
INTRODUCTION

This is a fork of the JCalendar project. The two main differences are:

 * this fork uses Maven 2
 * this fork supports TimeZones

=======================================================================
USAGE

The JDateChooser class has a new method called setDateFormatCalendar.
The underlying implementation will use the TimeZone of the selected
calendar when displaying the date and time.

=======================================================================
UPDATES

JCalendar is updated from time to time. Whenever a new version comes
out, I shall try my best to merge changes from Kai Toedter's branch
into this fork.
